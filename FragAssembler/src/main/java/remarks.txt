-   general things:
    -   consider intensities in all match steps
    -   check for multiple assignments/symmetry in match.Match class in 
        matchSpectra() method (at "-> still open")
    -   add exceptions where needed
    -   optimizing the steps for SSC extension?
    -   consider charges, i.e. in HOSE code generation/usage and assembly process 
        when checking for being a final SSC
    -   ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap when using parallel mode?
    -   consider special bond/valency case for N, P and S in assembly step
    -   some structures in NMRShiftDB include not an assignment for each carbon 
        atom to a signal, i.e. when equivalent signals in symmetries are 
        not explicit given -> those structures will be ignored completely for now

-   how to make it faster (and thinner):
    -   usage of connection matrix only instead of IAtomContainer?
    -   generally usage of documents from MongoDB or JSON objects 
        instead of SSC class objects?
