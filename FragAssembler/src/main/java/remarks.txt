-   general things:
    -   consider intensities in all match steps
    -   set aromaticities in each SSC sustructure too? -> information is lost 
        after building fragments
    -   check for multiple assignments/symmetry in match.Match class in 
        matchSpectra() method 
    -   add exceptions where needed
    -   deep cloning of SSC class (and used objects within that)
    -   optimizing the steps for SSC extension?
    -   consider charges in HOSE code generation/usage
    -   ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap when using parallel mode?
    -   consider special bond/valency case for N, P and S in assembly step
    -   some structures in NMRShiftDB include not an assignment for each carbon 
        atom to a signal, i.e. when equivalent signals in symmetries are 
        not explicit given -> those structures will be ignored completely for now

-   how to make it faster:
    -   usage of connection matrix only instead of IAtomContainer?
    -   pre-search usage when reading MongoDB collection?
        - then use only those SSCs as SSC library
    - generally usage of documents from MongoDB instead of SSC class objects?
