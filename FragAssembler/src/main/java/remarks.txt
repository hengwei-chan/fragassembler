-   consider intensities in (ArrayList<Integer>) SSC.findMatches() and SSC.getClosestMatch()
-   usage of RMS values? ArrayList<> findMatches() -> presearch?
-   check for multiple assignments/symmetry in SSC class
-   add exceptions where needed
-   deep cloning of SSC class (and used objects within that)
-   unique parent assignments in SSC class: updateParentAtomIndicesInHOSECodeSpheres()
-   where to use the open-sphere information
    -   during SSC extension
    -   as indicator after SSC entension?
-   optimizing the steps for SSC extension?
