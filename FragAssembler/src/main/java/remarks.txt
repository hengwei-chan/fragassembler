-   consider intensities in all match steps
-   check for multiple assignments/symmetry in Assembly class (findMatches() 
    and isSSCValid())
-   add exceptions where needed
-   deep cloning of SSC class (and used objects within that)
-   unique parent assignments in SSC class: updateParentAtomIndicesInHOSECodeSpheres()
-   where to use the open-sphere information
    -   during SSC extension
    -   as indicator after SSC entension?
-   optimizing the steps for SSC extension?
